# Aim
- Centralize `proto` files used to defined the interfaces to the Massa node,
- Abstract bindings generation,
- Centralize generated bindings.

# Current state
So far this project is in early stage. It only defines few `proto::Messages` that are used to generate `Rust` bindings to access the “Massa” node ABI for SmartContract implementation.

# Autogenerated parts
The outputs of the current generation process goes in:

```shell
# for the docs
doc/
# for the Rust bindings
src/_includes.rs
src/massa.abi.v1.rs
```

# Generation process
More documentation about this process can be found in `./proto/README.md`.
